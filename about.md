# About Myself

My name is Alex Ostrovski. I’m developing software and doing
other software architect things. Lately, most of software development
I’ve performed was in [Rust] and concerned distributed P2P systems
and blockchain in particular.

Besides Rust, I know JavaScript and basics of several more
programming languages (such as Python and Java) and not-so-programming
languages such as LaTeX and CSS / HTML. To throw in some more buzzwords,
before going into software development, I had a brief scientific career
in machine learning (more precisely, [bioinformatics] / structural recognition
and [ranking algorithms] before that).

## Areas of Interest

- Distributed / decentralized systems
- Applied cryptography, in distributed / decentralized systems or otherwise
- Machine learning
- Software correctness and formal verification
- Web development (especially now that tools for *safe* Web development
  start to emerge, such as WASM)

## Professional Projects

- [Exonum](https://exonum.com/), a framework for permissioned blockchains.
  The main components of the framework are open-sourced [on GitHub](https://github.com/exonum/). 
- [Lightning Peach](https://bitfurypeach.com/), a toolkit for rapidly developing
  apps using the Bitcoin [Lightning Network].
